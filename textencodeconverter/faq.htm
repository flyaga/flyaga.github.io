<p><b>Who would need Text Encode Converter, and for what purpose?</b></p>  
<p>* People who have text files with unkown text encodings, and receive emails 
or files that don&#39;t display properly, simply because the text encoding is 
incompatible with their system.<br>   
<br>
* People who have a vast number of text files in an older non-Unicode format 
that needs to be upgraded to Unicode. or people whose files needs to be 
converted from Unicode to an older format for legacy systems.<br>   
<br>
* People who want to convert a file&#39;s newline formatting to or from DOS (CR/LF), 
Unix (LF), Mac (CR) newline format.</p>

    <td width="72%">Destination file path. For example, -dp:&quot;d:\dest&quot;<br>
    if this parameter is ignored, the source file will be converted to the same

    from the graphical interface, please see the following red frame.<br>
    For example, -dn:0, means DON&#39;T convert the newline format. For this 
    setting, the source file&#39;s newline formatting is preserved in the 
    destination file, altered only as needed to satisfy the requirements of the 
    destination encoding code. <br>

<p><b>Command Line Example 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  
</b>tec &quot;c:\source file\*.php&quot; -de:41 -b2b -is<br>
This will convert *.php files in the &quot;c:\source file\&quot; folder, and its 
sub-folders,
<a href="http://www.gofunnow.com/convertutf8/convertutf8.php?destencoding=41">to the utf-8 file encoding format</a>, and it will backup the original 
source files to the same folder using the .bak file extension</p>   
<p><b>Command Line Example 2:</b><br>
tec &quot;c:\source file\*.php&quot; -de:-2 -dn:1 -dp:&quot;d:\dest file\&quot; -is -ew:.bak<br>
This will convert *.php files in &quot;c:\source file&quot; and its sub-folders
<a href="http://www.gofunnow.com/convertutf8/convertutf8.php?destencoding=-2">to the 
utf-8 no bom file encoding format</a>, and
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gofunnow.com/convertutf8/convertutf8.php?destencoding=0&srcencoding=0&destnewline=1">convert to unix newline format</a>, the 
destination file path is the folder &quot;d:\dest file&quot;, and it will not convert .bak 
files in source file path.</p> 
<p><b>What's Unicode?</b><br>
Unicode provides a unique number for every character, no matter what the 
platform, no matter what the program, no matter what the language. There are 
several Unicode encodings: the most popular is UTF-8 and UTF-16. UTF-8 uses a 
variable-length character encoding, and all basic Latin character codes are 
identical to ASCII.</p>
